    "### Vector\n",
    "A vector is a mathematical object composed of both magnitude and direction. It is commonly represented as an ordered pair or column vector. For example, the vector v = (4, 2) represents a movement of 4 units in the horizontal direction and 2 units in the vertical direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scalar Multiplication Effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change in direction: Multiplying a vector by -1 reverses its direction. For example, -1 * v = (-4, -2) represents a movement in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change in magnitude: Scaling a vector by a scalar factor affects its magnitude. For instance, 2 * v = (8, 4) represents a doubling of the original magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change in both magnitude and direction: A combination of scalar multiplication and direction reversal results in changes to both magnitude and direction. For instance, -2 * v = (-8, -4) represents a movement in the opposite direction with doubled magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit Vectors\n",
    "A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of 1, used to indicate direction in a given space. It is obtained by dividing a vector by its magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a vector v represented by coordinates (x, y), its unit vector u is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "u = v / ||v||\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "u is the unit vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "v is the original vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "||v|| denotes the magnitude of the vector v.\n",
    "For example, for the vector (3, 4), the unit vector can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "u = (3, 4) / sqrt(3^2 + 4^2)\n",
    "u = (3/5, 4/5)\n",
    "\n",
    "This unit vector represents the direction of the original vector (3, 4) with a magnitude of 1.\n",
