# An Overview of Reinforcement Learning

### Foundations
- Markov Decision Processes
- Exploration vs. Exploitation

### Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (Bellman equations, value iteration, and policy iteration)
- Monte Carlo Methods
- Temporal Difference Learning (SARSA, Q-Learning)

### Model-Free vs. Model-Based
- Model-Free
- Model-Based

### Deep RL
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods (REINFORCE and Actor-Critic Methods)
- Trsut Region Methods (TRPO and PPO)

### Value Funcation Approximation
- Fuction Approximation
- Representation Learning

### Advanced Topics
- Inverse RL
- Multi-Agent RL
- Hierarchical RL
- Meta-Learning

### Exploration Techniques
- Epsilon-Greedy Strategy
- Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty
- Entropy-Based Models

### Scalability and Efficiency
